## Object Counting
This repository contains code for identifying number of straws from a given image. The same code can further be modified to count other circular things, such as wood logs.

Two methods are used here,
* Edge detection followed by morphological operations
* Trained CNN classifier using custom data

I trained classifier only for learning purpose. Basic image processing steps give better result in this problem.
